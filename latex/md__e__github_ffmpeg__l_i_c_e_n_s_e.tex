Most files in F\+Fmpeg are under the G\+NU Lesser General Public License version 2.\+1 or later (L\+G\+PL v2.\+1+). Read the file {\ttfamily C\+O\+P\+Y\+I\+N\+G.\+L\+G\+P\+Lv2.\+1} for details. Some other files have M\+I\+T/\+X11/\+B\+S\+D-\/style licenses. In combination the L\+G\+PL v2.\+1+ applies to F\+Fmpeg.

Some optional parts of F\+Fmpeg are licensed under the G\+NU General Public License version 2 or later (G\+PL v2+). See the file {\ttfamily C\+O\+P\+Y\+I\+N\+G.\+G\+P\+Lv2} for details. None of these parts are used by default, you have to explicitly pass {\ttfamily -\/-\/enable-\/gpl} to configure to activate them. In this case, F\+Fmpeg\textquotesingle{}s license changes to G\+PL v2+.

Specifically, the G\+PL parts of F\+Fmpeg are\+:

Should you, for whatever reason, prefer to use version 3 of the (L)G\+PL, then the configure parameter {\ttfamily -\/-\/enable-\/version3} will activate this licensing option for you. Read the file {\ttfamily C\+O\+P\+Y\+I\+N\+G.\+L\+G\+P\+Lv3} or, if you have enabled G\+PL parts, {\ttfamily C\+O\+P\+Y\+I\+N\+G.\+G\+P\+Lv3} to learn the exact legal terms that apply in this case.

There are a handful of files under other licensing terms, namely\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The files {\ttfamily libavcodec/jfdctfst.\+c}, {\ttfamily libavcodec/jfdctint\+\_\+template.\+c} and {\ttfamily libavcodec/jrevdct.\+c} are taken from libjpeg, see the top of the files for licensing details. Specifically note that you must credit the I\+JG in the documentation accompanying your program if you only distribute executables. You must also indicate any changes including additions and deletions to those three files in the documentation.
\item {\ttfamily tests/reference.\+pnm} is under the expat license.

F\+Fmpeg can be combined with a number of external libraries, which sometimes affect the licensing of binaries resulting from the combination.\hypertarget{md__e__github_ffmpeg__l_i_c_e_n_s_e_autotoc_md28}{}\doxysubsection{Compatible libraries}\label{md__e__github_ffmpeg__l_i_c_e_n_s_e_autotoc_md28}
The following libraries are under G\+PL version 2\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item avisynth
\item frei0r
\item libcdio
\item libdavs2
\item librubberband
\item libvidstab
\item libx264
\item libx265
\item libxavs
\item libxavs2
\item libxvid
\end{DoxyItemize}

When combining them with F\+Fmpeg, F\+Fmpeg needs to be licensed as G\+PL as well by passing {\ttfamily -\/-\/enable-\/gpl} to configure.

The following libraries are under L\+G\+PL version 3\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item gmp
\item libaribb24
\item liblensfun
\end{DoxyItemize}

When combining them with F\+Fmpeg, use the configure option {\ttfamily -\/-\/enable-\/version3} to upgrade F\+Fmpeg to the L\+G\+PL v3.

The V\+M\+AF, mbed\+T\+LS, RK M\+PI, Open\+C\+O\+RE and Visual\+On libraries are under the Apache License 2.\+0. That license is incompatible with the L\+G\+PL v2.\+1 and the G\+PL v2, but not with version 3 of those licenses. So to combine these libraries with F\+Fmpeg, the license version needs to be upgraded by passing {\ttfamily -\/-\/enable-\/version3} to configure.

The smbclient library is under the G\+PL v3, to combine it with F\+Fmpeg, the options {\ttfamily -\/-\/enable-\/gpl} and {\ttfamily -\/-\/enable-\/version3} have to be passed to configure to upgrade F\+Fmpeg to the G\+PL v3.\hypertarget{md__e__github_ffmpeg__l_i_c_e_n_s_e_autotoc_md29}{}\doxysubsection{Incompatible libraries}\label{md__e__github_ffmpeg__l_i_c_e_n_s_e_autotoc_md29}
There are certain libraries you can combine with F\+Fmpeg whose licenses are not compatible with the G\+PL and/or the L\+G\+PL. If you wish to enable these libraries, even in circumstances that their license may be incompatible, pass {\ttfamily -\/-\/enable-\/nonfree} to configure. This will cause the resulting binary to be unredistributable.

The Fraunhofer F\+DK A\+AC and Open\+S\+SL libraries are under licenses which are incompatible with the G\+P\+Lv2 and v3. To the best of our knowledge, they are compatible with the L\+G\+PL.
