\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Utilities for manipulating memory.

F\+Fmpeg has several applications of memory that are not required of a typical program. For example, the computing-\/heavy components like video decoding and encoding can be sped up significantly through the use of aligned memory.

However, for each of F\+Fmpeg\textquotesingle{}s applications of memory, there might not be a recognized or standardized A\+PI for that specific use. Memory alignment, for instance, varies wildly depending on operating systems, architectures, and compilers. Hence, this component of libavutil is created to make dealing with memory consistently possible on all platforms.
