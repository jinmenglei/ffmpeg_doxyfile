This example will generate a sine wave audio, pass it through a simple filter chain, and then compute the M\+D5 checksum of the output data.

The filter chain it uses is\+: (input) -\/$>$ abuffer -\/$>$ volume -\/$>$ aformat -\/$>$ abuffersink -\/$>$ (output)

abuffer\+: This provides the endpoint where you can feed the decoded samples. volume\+: In this example we hardcode it to 0.\+90. aformat\+: This converts the samples to the samplefreq, channel layout, and sample format required by the audio device. abuffersink\+: This provides the endpoint where you can read the samples after they have passed through the filter chain.
